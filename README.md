# Write-Out
This is a simple blog  web app using Django.
(Use **python3** in the commands if you are having pyhton3 or use your virtual environment path !)

This can be deployed on any web hosting platform.

##IMPORTANT
------------
In order to post the blog, one needs to be the admin. Visitors can only see the blog. So here is how to  post blog:

1.  Head to <url.com>/admin
2. username:  admin
   password:  djangoisawesome
3. Go to "blog post"
4. Add any blog or modify  or  delete.

To change the password  of the admin,  follow these command
  * Go to "writeout" directory.
  * **>>python manage.py changepassword admin**  
   This will ask for the new password. So, use a strong password.
   
I will be slowly upgrading this project.
